# To-do-app
A to-do app is a productivity tool that helps users organize and manage their tasks and responsibilities. 
Key features commonly found in a to-do app include:

Task Creation: Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do lists, providing a title, description, due date, and any additional relevant details.

Task Organization: To-do apps often allow users to categorize and organize tasks into different lists or categories, such as work, personal, shopping, or project-specific lists.

Prioritization and Reminders: Users can set priorities for tasks, such as high, medium, or low, to ensure they focus on important items. Reminders can be set to notify users of upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks.

Task Completion Tracking: As users complete tasks, they can mark them as done or check them off the list, providing a sense of progress and accomplishment.

Collaboration and Sharing: Some to-do apps offer collaboration features, enabling users to share tasks and lists with others, delegate responsibilities, or work together on shared projects.

Integration and Synchronization: To-do apps often integrate with other tools and platforms, such as calendars, email clients, or project management systems. Synchronization across devices ensures that tasks and updates are accessible from smartphones, tablets, and computers.
